🌞 Planet and Moon Animation using HTML & CSS
This is a small practice project where I created a glowing Sun and a Moon using only HTML and CSS.
It shows the basic concepts of shapes, shadows, gradients, and glowing effects, and can be extended with simple animations like orbiting.

Dim Moon with a shadow gradient.
